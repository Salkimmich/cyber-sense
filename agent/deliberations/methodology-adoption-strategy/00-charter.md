  goal: "Given four scenarios for how cyberneutics methodology adoption might unfold over 12 months, what strategic direction should the project pursue?"
  context: "Deliberating across scenario set generated in agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/. The scenarios explore four quadrants of a depth-vs-breadth × growth-vs-stagnation space. The project currently has three early adoption signals but no sustained external usage."

# Charter: Methodology Adoption Strategy

This is a scenario-aware committee deliberation — the convergent (funnel) half of the deliberated-choice workflow. The committee reads and deliberates across the four scenarios generated by `/scenarios` in `agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/`. The question is not "which scenario is most likely?" but "given these possible futures, what should the project do?"
