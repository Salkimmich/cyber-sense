# Remediation Round 1: Response to Evaluation

**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Evaluation file**: 04-evaluation-1.md
**Score**: 12/15 (threshold: 13)

## Motion to Recommit

The independent evaluation scored this deliberation at 12/15, below the threshold of 13. The committee accepts the motion to recommit and addresses the three recommendations below.

## Point-by-Point Response to Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Add a Round 3 where one character steelmans the skeptical case

**Accept.** The evaluator is correct that premature unanimity on the primary question compressed the debate space. Every member opened with "not a crackpot" and the adversarial energy displaced entirely to secondary questions. The evaluator's specific suggestion — Maya should argue that the closed-loop concern explains *all* the positive evidence — is well-targeted. If the AI can generate failure-modes essays, formalism extensions, and worked examples on demand, then none of these artifacts distinguish genuine insight from capable generation.

**What the committee will add:** Round 3 where Maya steelmans the closed-loop-explains-everything reading, Joe supports with historical examples of self-referential intellectual projects that looked healthy from the inside, and the remaining members must identify *specific evidence* inconsistent with the closed-loop explanation. The probability distribution will be re-derived from this stress test.

### Recommendation 2: Vic should demonstrate a concrete nesting failure

**Accept with amendment.** The evaluator correctly identifies that Vic's concession on monad associativity passed on assertion. However, constructing a fully worked nesting failure requires examining the palgebra formalism in detail, which the committee can do but which may produce a toy example that proves less than it appears.

**What the committee will add:** Vic will construct the nesting scenario as requested, but will also honestly assess whether the failure is one that intuition would have caught anyway. The goal is an honest assessment of the formalism's marginal constraint power, not a post-hoc demonstration designed to vindicate the concession.

### Recommendation 3: Anchor the probability distribution

**Accept.** The evaluator's critique that the numbers are "vibes with decimal points" is fair. The original distribution was stated with one-sentence justifications.

**What the committee will add:** Explicit calibration anchors — observable evidence that would shift each outcome's probability by ±10%. The revised distribution will be derived from the Round 3 stress test, not simply restated with better justification.

## Summary of New Round

The committee will append to 02-deliberation.md:
- **Response to evaluation (motion to recommit)**: framing the remediation
- **Round 3**: Maya steelmans the closed-loop reading; Joe supports; Vic constructs a nesting scenario; committee stress-tests the probability distribution; revised distribution with calibration anchors
- **Updated Final Consensus**: incorporating the stress test results
