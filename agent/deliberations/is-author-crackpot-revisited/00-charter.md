charter:
  goal: "Re-assess whether the author of this repository is a crackpot, given the substantially expanded evidence base since the original deliberation (2026-02-17). The repo now contains 18 essays, 17+ artifacts with worked examples, a formal algebra (palgebra), 5 completed deliberations, a live fan→funnel pipeline test, an honest failure-modes essay, and onboarding documentation."
  context: |
    On 2026-02-17, the committee assessed this question and concluded: not a crackpot
    (5% probability), most likely a competent practitioner with overtheorized framework (60%).
    Key concerns at that time included: no failure cases documented, no worked examples,
    no comparative evaluation, theory might be decorative rather than load-bearing, no
    adoption path, and no independent usage. Since then, the repository has grown
    substantially. The committee must evaluate the CURRENT state of the repo — not update
    priors from the old deliberation but assess fresh, using whatever evidence they find.

    Evidence available now (not exhaustive — committee should examine the repo):
    - 18 essays including when-methodology-fails.md (honest failure-mode engineering)
    - 17+ artifacts including 3 worked examples (hiring, repository review, full pipeline)
    - Formal algebra (palgebra): 5 documents formalizing pipelines as resource equations
    - 5 completed committee deliberations with full records
    - 1 scenario generation suite + live fan→funnel pipeline test
    - Start Here onboarding path and Quick Start Guide
    - Fan/funnel duality formalized as categorical dual (product/coproduct)
    - Decision monad structure with iteration for mapping decision landscapes
    - Application domain: narrative immune systems

    Prior deliberation record: agent/deliberations/is-author-crackpot/
    (preserved for comparison; this is a fresh assessment, not an extension)
  success_criteria:
    - "Fresh verdict on crackpot vs. sound, calibrated to the current repo state"
    - "Explicit comparison of what has changed since the original deliberation"
    - "Assessment of whether the original concerns have been addressed, partially addressed, or remain open"
    - "Updated probability distribution over outcomes"
    - "Evidence requirements that remain unmet"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee verdict with updated probability distribution"
    - "Delta analysis: what moved and what didn't since 2026-02-17"
    - "Decision space map and remaining evidence requirements"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact + Decision Space Map + Delta Analysis"
