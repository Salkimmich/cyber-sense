# Convening Record

**Date**: 2026-02-21

**Selection strategy**: Standard roster from `agent/roster.md`.

**Rationale**: The same roster that ran the original is-author-crackpot deliberation on 2026-02-17. Using the identical roster ensures the delta between verdicts reflects changes in evidence, not changes in committee composition.

**Composition notes**: Key productive tensions for this topic:
- **Maya vs. Frankie**: Maya will probe whether the new documentation is substance or polish; Frankie will argue for what the expanded work represents as a values commitment.
- **Vic vs. Joe**: Vic will prosecute whether the new evidence actually addresses the gaps flagged in the original deliberation; Joe will ask whether the growth pattern resembles successful interdisciplinary projects or failed ones.
- **Tammy vs. all**: Tammy will trace whether the repo's internal structure exhibits the feedback loops of a healthy intellectual project or the self-referential loops of an echo chamber.

**Outcome**: Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
