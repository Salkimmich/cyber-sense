# Phase 1: Convening (backfilled)

**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Selection strategy:** Standard 5-member roster

## Rationale

The fixed cyber-sense roster provides maximum diversity: paranoid realism (Maya), idealism (Frankie), continuity (Joe), evidence (Vic), systems thinking (Tammy). Appropriate for assessing whether an interdisciplinary synthesis and its author are sound or crackpot. See `artifacts/character-propensity-reference.md`.

## Composition notes

- **Tensions:** Maya vs Frankie (suspicion of self-reference vs. intellectual honesty); Vic demands evidence; Joe checks synthesis against history; Tammy maps system coherence.
- **Grounding:** Joe (precedent for synthesis success/failure), Vic (testable claims, falsifiability).
- **Exploration:** Tammy (theory load-bearing vs. decorative), Frankie (values and clarity vs. mystification).

## Outcome

Committee convened with 5 members. See 01-roster.yml.
