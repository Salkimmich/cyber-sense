# Phase 3: Resolution (backfilled from transcript verdict and conclusion)
resolution:
  date: "2026-02-17"
  topic: "Is the author of this repo a crackpot?"
  outcome: "PASSED"
  decision: "Not a crackpot; jury still out on how valuable the framework is. Smart move is critical engagement, not dismissal or uncritical adoption."
  summary: |
    The committee assessed the repository's synthesis of cybernetics, sense-making,
    narrative cognition, and adversarial committee methodology. Verdict: unlikely to be
    a crackpot (external sources legitimate, internal coherence high, failure modes
    documented, no grift). Probability distribution: 60% competent practitioner with
    overtheorized framework, 25% genuinely innovative synthesis, 10% intellectual
    overengineering, 5% actual crackpot. Evidence gap remains: no systematic comparative
    validation; needs independent adoption and failure cases. Recommendation: treat as
    promising methodology worth testing; contribute to validation or falsification.
