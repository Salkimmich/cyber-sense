# Phase 0: Charter (backfilled from committee-transcript-2026-02-17-is-author-crackpot.md)
charter:
  goal: "Assess whether the author of this repository is a crackpot, given its synthesis of cybernetics, sense-making theory, narrative cognition, and adversarial committee methodology."
  context: |
    The repository synthesizes cybernetics (von Foerster, Bateson), sense-making theory (Dervin),
    process philosophy (Deleuze), narrative cognition (Bruner, Kahneman), and computational
    narrative intelligence into a methodology for working with LLMs. It claims LLMs are
    "narrative engines" requiring adversarial deliberation to prevent collapse to statistical
    likelihood. Includes both theoretical essays and practical artifacts (committee rosters,
    evaluation rubrics, procedural templates).
    Stakes: If sound, this represents useful methodology for complex AI collaboration.
    If crackpot, it's intellectual overengineering that obscures rather than clarifies.
  success_criteria:
    - "Clear verdict on crackpot vs. sound (with uncertainty acknowledged)"
    - "Evidence requirements identified to distinguish sound methodology from crackpot theorizing"
    - "Decision space map for how to engage with the framework (caution vs. adoption vs. rigor)"
  exit_conditions:
    - "Committee verdict with probability distribution over outcomes"
    - "Decision space map and recommended next steps for validation"
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact (YAML) + Decision Space Map"
