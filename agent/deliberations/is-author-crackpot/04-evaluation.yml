  verdict: "Medium"
  verdict_summary: "Decent but gaps — meaningful weaknesses. Safe to use as input to the decision (critical engagement vs. dismissal/adoption) but reasoning and evidence gaps should be tightened if the deliberation were regenerated."

  reasoning_completeness:
    score: 2
    citation: "Joe's opening: explicit mapping of Dervin → prompting (situation, gap, query, response, transformed understanding), von Foerster 'partially,' Bruner/Kahneman 'actually yes' with Societies of Thought paper, Deleuze 'debatable.' Vic cites arXiv:2601.10825 and testable claims. Maya gives asymmetry then mechanism: 'If someone follows the protocol exactly and it still fails, that's clean falsification.'"
    gap: "Some transitions are compressed (e.g. from 'theory partially load-bearing' to '60% competent practitioner'); the probability distribution is asserted without showing how each character's position maps onto the percentages."

  adversarial_rigor:
    score: 2
    citation: "Direct exchanges: VIC → MAYA (falsifiability), MAYA concedes ('Fair point... So maybe it's falsifiable in practice'). FRANKIE → JOE (Deleuze load-bearing), JOE → FRANKIE (Occam's razor). TAMMY → ALL (system question), VIC → TAMMY (eigenforms, soft types as theory-enabled practice). MAYA → FRANKIE (echo chamber), FRANKIE (external validation, then concedes need for independent application)."
    gap: "Single round of debate; the final probability distribution (60/25/10/5) is not stress-tested by the committee—no one challenges the numbers or asks what would shift them. Consensus emerges without a second round on the verdict itself."

  assumption_surfacing:
    score: 2
    citation: "ASSUMPTIONS SURFACED section names three: (1) complex problems require sophisticated approach — Challenge (Joe), Support (Tammy); (2) synthesis adds value — Challenge (Joe/Maya), Support (Vic/Frankie); (3) framework generally applicable — 'All agree: untested.' DECISION SPACE MAP states optimization options (caution vs. adoption vs. rigor) with explicit trade-offs."
    gap: "The definition of 'crackpot' is left implicit (incoherent theory, non-functional practices, fraud/self-deception). Meta-assumption that the repo is representative of the author's work is not stated."

  evidence_standards:
    score: 2
    citation: "Vic: 'Before calling this validated methodology, I need to see comparative data'; 'promising framework worth testing, not established practice.' EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS list five concrete tests (comparative evaluation, independent adoption, failure cases, theory-necessity test, longitudinal improvement). Maya's unfalsifiability claim is challenged by Vic with rubric scoring as falsification mechanism."
    gap: "Claims that 'theory is at least partially load-bearing' (eigenforms, soft types) are supported by examples but not by systematic evidence. The 60/25/10/5 distribution is not tied to stated evidence or criteria."

  tradeoff_explicitness:
    score: 3
    citation: "DECISION SPACE MAP: each of three options has explicit 'You sacrifice' and 'You gain.' Verdict lists four outcomes with clear consequences (e.g. '60%: techniques sound, theory maybe unnecessary, philosophy becomes optional background'). No win-win framing; recommendation is 'critical engagement' with trade-offs acknowledged."
    gap: "None material; trade-offs are specific."

  structural_assessment:
    charter_fitness: "The deliberation directly addresses the charter: verdict on crackpot vs. sound (with uncertainty), evidence requirements, and decision space map are all delivered."
    character_calibration: "Maya is suspicious but concedes when countered (Vic); Frankie principled but acknowledges need for external application; Joe historically specific (Shannon, cybernetics, Sokal); Vic evidence-proportional; Tammy traces systems without overcomplicating. All stay in role."
    engagement_depth: "Debate evolves: opening positions → direct challenges → concessions and refinements (Maya on falsifiability, Frankie on independent application). Tammy reframes the question (theory load-bearing vs. decorative); Vic supplies concrete examples. Terms of the argument shift from 'is it crackpot?' to 'sound enough for what?'"
    synthesis_quality: "Synthesis honestly represents tensions (four KEY TENSIONS, three ASSUMPTIONS, probability distribution). Does not smooth over the evidence gap or the 'unlikely but not ruled out' conclusion."

  biggest_gaps:
    - "The 60/25/10/5 probability distribution is asserted in the verdict without being debated or derived from criteria; a second round could have stress-tested it."
    - "Reasoning from 'theory partially load-bearing' and 'external sources legitimate' to the specific percentage breakdown is implicit rather than shown step by step."

  recommendations:
    - "If regenerating: add a short round where Vic or Joe challenges the probability distribution—what evidence would shift the 60%? What would move crackpot above 10%?"
    - "Make the mapping from 'theory load-bearing' / 'falsifiable in practice' / 'not sealed' to the four outcome buckets explicit in one paragraph before the percentages."
