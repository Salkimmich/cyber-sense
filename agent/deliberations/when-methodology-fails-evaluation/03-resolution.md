  date: 2026-02-21
  topic: "Quality and uptake impact of 'When This Methodology Fails' essay"
  outcome: PASSED
  decision: "Publish with minor revisions: add empirical caveat, expand unknown-unknowns note, brief mentions of power asymmetry and model degradation."
  summary: >
    The committee evaluated the essay against its stated purpose (honest engineering
    assessment of methodology limitations) and its strategic purpose (credibility-building
    for adoption). Verdict: the essay delivers on both. It is specific, actionable,
    self-aware, and written in the engineering voice the project needs. Four minor
    revisions were identified: (1) explicit statement that failure modes are predicted,
    not empirically documented, (2) expanded treatment of unknown unknowns in the
    self-application section, (3) brief mention of asymmetric power problem in Failure
    Mode 4, (4) brief mention of model capability degradation as operational concern.
    The essay should be referenced in the quickstart guide as recommended reading
    before first committee use. Uptake assessment: positive — trust-building and
    self-selection feedback loops dominate deterrence.
  details: >
    The committee identified three key tensions: (1) how much credibility the essay
    should cost the methodology (Maya wants more, Frankie defends the balance struck),
    (2) whether conceptual vs. empirical failure modes need explicit labeling (consensus:
    yes), (3) scope of failure analysis (consensus: stay focused on methodology, mention
    adjacent concerns briefly). The strongest sections were identified as the scope
    map (practical decision framework for practitioners) and the detection heuristics
    (specific, testable, actionable). The weakest element is the brevity of the
    unknown-unknowns acknowledgment — the essay's deepest limitation gets the least
    space. Tammy's feedback loop analysis found the essay strengthens positive loops
    (trust, self-selection) more than negative ones (deterrence, over-correction).

# Resolution: Evaluation of "When This Methodology Fails"

## Decision

**Publish with minor revisions.** The essay delivers on its credibility promise and will help drive adoption among sophisticated practitioners.

## Revisions Recommended

1. **Empirical caveat** (Vic, Joe): Add a brief statement — in the "Why this essay exists" section or as a note after the six failure modes — that these are predicted failure modes from a methodology with limited empirical data. As actual failure cases are documented, the essay should be updated.

2. **Unknown unknowns** (Maya): Expand the self-application section's two sentences about failure modes invisible from within the training distribution. This is the essay's deepest limitation and deserves more than a passing mention.

3. **Power asymmetry** (Maya): In Failure Mode 4 (user abdicates editorial role), add a brief note about the risk that the methodology's formal apparatus can be used to justify predetermined conclusions, creating an asymmetry against subordinates who disagree.

4. **Model degradation** (Joe): Add a brief note somewhere appropriate (Failure Mode 2 or the robustness section) that model capability changes over time can invalidate character calibration.

## Integration Actions

- Reference the essay in the quickstart guide as recommended reading before first committee use.
- Add the essay to the Skeptics reading path in essays/README.md. *(Already done.)*

## Uptake Assessment

The essay will help, not hurt, adoption. It builds trust with the practitioners the project most wants to reach (sophisticated, methodology-aware, skeptical of hype). The self-selection effect — practitioners who read the scope map and correctly determine the methodology isn't for their problem — is a feature, not a bug.

## Monitoring

- Track whether practitioners who read the limitations essay first show different engagement patterns.
- Revisit the essay after 3-6 months to add empirical failure cases.
- Watch for Loop 4 (over-correction): if practitioners cite the limitations document as a reason *not* to try the methodology on appropriate problems, the essay's tone may need adjustment.
