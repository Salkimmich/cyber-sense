  goal: "Evaluate the quality and uptake impact of the new essay 'When This Methodology Fails' (essays/when-methodology-fails.md). Is it good enough to publish? Will it help drive adoption? What's missing or wrong?"
  context: "The essay was identified as a robust action by the methodology-adoption-strategy committee (Q2 2026 deadline). Maya specifically called it 'the single most credibility-building thing the project could produce.' It covers six failure modes with mechanisms, detection heuristics, and recovery strategies. The question is whether it delivers on that promise."

# Charter: Evaluation of "When This Methodology Fails"

This deliberation evaluates the quality and strategic impact of a new essay that was one of four robust actions recommended by the methodology-adoption-strategy committee. The essay maps six failure modes of the cyberneutics methodology, each with mechanisms, detection heuristics, and recovery strategies. The committee should assess: Is it honest enough? Is it specific enough? Does it help or hurt adoption?
