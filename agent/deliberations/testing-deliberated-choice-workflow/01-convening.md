# Convening: Testing the Deliberated-Choice Workflow

**Date**: 2026-02-21

**Selection strategy**: Standard roster from `agent/roster.md`.

**Rationale**: Testing a methodology pipeline is a sociotechnical problem — it involves design judgments (what makes a good test?), empirical concerns (what evidence do we need?), historical awareness (how have previous tests in this repo gone?), and systems thinking (what does the composition seam expose?). The full roster provides coverage across all these dimensions.

**Composition notes**:
- **Maya × Vic** tension: Maya will push for testing scenarios that expose political or hidden failure modes in the workflow; Vic will demand concrete, measurable pass/fail criteria. This tension will prevent both vague "it feels right" acceptance and paranoid over-specification.
- **Joe × Frankie** tension: Joe will draw on lessons from past testing in this repo (the Python 3.7 bug, UTF-8 encoding issues — bugs found only by running, not reading); Frankie will insist the test should validate the *purpose* of the workflow (better decisions), not just its mechanical operation.
- **Tammy × all**: Tammy will trace second-order effects — how does the choice of test problem shape what we learn? What feedback loops exist between the test and the thing being tested?

**Remediation parameters**: Default (threshold 13, max 2 rounds).

**Outcome**: Committee convened. See 01-roster.md.
