# Evaluation Feedback Loop — merged into augmentation plan

**Status:** Implemented. This file is archived in `agent/archive/` for reference.

**This plan was coalesced into the single augmentation plan.** See **agent/archive/augmentation-plan.md**:

- **§8. Evaluation feedback loop (remediation)** — Locked-in design: sum of five rubrics (0–15), threshold sum &lt; 13 (default), max 2 remediation rounds, convening override; artifacts 04-evaluation-1.yml, 05-remediation-1.md, 06-evaluation-2.yml, …; committee remediation mode; review skill changes.
- **§9. Implementation status** — All items are now done (directory, 00–03, 04-evaluation-1 naming, sum/threshold, remediation mode, convening overrides).

The full design narrative (schemes A vs B, motion to recommit, “what would have to change”) was previously in this file; the authoritative summary and implementation checklist now live in augmentation-plan.md. This file is retained only as a pointer so old links or references still resolve.
