# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21 (third session)

## Session Summary

**Duration**: Single session. Continues from the earlier 2026-02-21 implementation session (archived as `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-c.md`) which implemented the fan/funnel skills. This session tested them.

**Main Accomplishments**:
- **First live test of the deliberated-choice workflow.** The previous handoff identified this as the top validation priority ("Live testing of new skills... have been implemented but not run on a real problem yet"). This session did that.
- **Committee-designed test plan**: Ran a committee deliberation on *how* to test the workflow. The committee produced a three-tier verification framework (structural/process/quality) with PASS/DEVIATION/FAIL classification and stage-gated execution.
- **First `/scenarios` run**: Generated four scenarios for methodology adoption strategy over 12 months. The 4-core roster (Continuity, Disruption, Opportunity, Constraint) produced genuinely distinct scenarios mapping all four quadrants of the depth/breadth × growth/stagnation space.
- **First scenario-aware `/committee` run**: Deliberated across the four scenarios with `scenario_context:` — the full fan→funnel composition. Committee engaged substantively with scenarios (not just name-dropping). Resolution format structurally differs from standard committee output (6 new YAML fields).
- **Post-run assessment**: 17 PASS, 1 DEVIATION, 0 FAIL across 19 verification checks. The pipeline composes.

**Original intent**: mg asked to "Run a committee debate on how to test the new deliberated-choice-workflow. Use their findings to devise a test plan. Then carry out that plan. Do not modify any existing materials, just add some."

**Actual outcome**: Exactly as requested. Three deliberation/scenario directories created, no existing files modified. The test plan from the first committee was executed in full and verified against its own criteria.

## Mistakes and Lessons

- **No mistakes in execution this session.** The pipeline produced correctly structured output at every stage. This is partly because the skill specs are well-designed (previous session's work), and partly because this was a first run without adversarial edge cases.
- **One spec deviation found**: The scenario-aware resolution's YAML schema goes beyond what `artifacts/deliberated-choice-workflow.md` prescribes. The spec describes resolution sections in prose (robust actions, scenario-dependent actions, monitoring plan, dismissed futures) but doesn't specify YAML field names or structure. The implementation used structured YAML (`robust_actions`, `scenario_dependent_actions`, `monitoring_plan` as typed YAML fields). This is additive, not contradictory — the spec should be updated to document the actual schema.
- **Lesson**: The committee's test plan was the right approach. Having the verification framework *before* running the test meant findings could be classified systematically (PASS/DEVIATION/FAIL) rather than evaluated impressionistically. Vic's insistence on stage-gated verification was vindicated — it made the assessment tractable.

## Dead Ends Explored

None. The session followed a linear path: test-planning committee → test plan extraction → scenario generation → scenario-aware committee → assessment. No approach was abandoned.

## Current State

### Completed This Session

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agent/deliberations/testing-deliberated-choice-workflow/` | **New.** Full deliberation record (00-charter through 04-evaluation-1). The test-planning committee and its post-run assessment. |
| `agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/` | **New.** First `/scenarios` run: 00-situation, 01-roster, 01-parameters, 02-scenarios (4 scenarios), 03-assessment. |
| `agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/` | **New.** First scenario-aware `/committee` run: 00-charter (with `scenario_context` and `scenarios_summary`), 01-roster, 01-convening, 02-deliberation, 03-resolution (with robust_actions, scenario_dependent_actions, monitoring_plan, dismissed_futures). |
| `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-c.md` | **New.** Archived previous handoff. |

### Deliberately Untouched

- **All existing files**: mg's instruction was "Do not modify any existing materials, just add some." Strictly followed.
- **No spec updates**: The DEVIATION (resolution YAML schema) was recorded but the spec was not updated.
- **No gap_analysis update**: The testing was recorded in its own assessment file, not in gap_analysis.

### In Progress

- **Nothing**; all new files are written and complete. Commit message provided but not committed (mg commits himself).

### Carried Forward (from previous handoffs, still relevant)

- **Remediation flow test**: is-author-crackpot (sum 11 < 13) remains a good candidate for evaluate → gate → remediate → re-evaluate. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Roster customization workflow**: Still no documented "how to change the roster." Open since 2026-02-20.
- **integration-with-moollm.md**: Still hardcodes roster by name. Open since 2026-02-20.
- **Spec calibration from test**: Three items identified in the assessment's "Spec Calibration Notes" — resolution YAML schema, scenarios assumption minimum count, charter bridge `key_assumption` singular vs. summary compression. These should be addressed when the specs are next touched.
- **`/probe` still untested**: `/scenarios` and scenario-aware `/committee` are now tested; `/probe` (N-run variance analysis) is the remaining untested skill.

### New items from this session

- **Robust actions from the adoption-strategy deliberation**: The committee recommended four robust actions by Q2 2026 — Start Here reading path, full-pipeline worked example, when-methodology-fails.md, monitoring infrastructure. These are *deliberation output*, not session commitments — mg decides whether to act on them. But they're substantive recommendations from a live committee run on a real problem.
- **The adoption-strategy deliberation as a potential worked example**: Joe noted during the deliberation that this very run could serve as the "full-pipeline worked example" recommended by the robust actions — it's a genuine fan→funnel pipeline used on a real decision, with full provenance. Meta, but authentic.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit**: mg has the commit message. The new files are all untracked.
2. **Push**: Branch may be ahead of origin.
3. **Spec calibration (optional)**: Update `artifacts/deliberated-choice-workflow.md` to document the resolution YAML schema that emerged from the first run. Small change; could be done in a future session.
4. **Remediation flow test** (carried): Run on is-author-crackpot. This is the next untested pipeline component.
5. **`/probe` test**: The last untested skill. Needs a situation worth probing N times — expensive, so pick carefully.
6. **Act on adoption-strategy recommendations (if desired)**: The committee recommended Start Here guide, worked example, limitations doc, monitoring. These are editorial decisions for mg.

## Working with mg: Session-Specific Insights

- **Delegation with constraints**: mg gave a single compound instruction ("Run a committee debate... Use their findings to devise a test plan... Carry out that plan... Do not modify any existing materials, just add some.") and expected autonomous execution. This is a progression from the plan-then-execute pattern in previous sessions — mg trusted the agent to plan internally (via the committee) rather than requiring explicit plan approval.
- **Commit discipline (confirmed again)**: mg asked for the commit message but explicitly said "don't commit." Third session confirming this pattern.
- **Handoff at session end (confirmed)**: mg invoked `/handoff` immediately after the commit message, same as previous sessions.
- **"Don't modify" constraint**: This is new. Previous sessions modified existing files freely (gap_analysis, CLAUDE.md, artifacts/README.md). This session mg explicitly restricted to additions only. Respect this when stated — it may reflect wanting to review changes to existing files separately.

## Open Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Adoption strategy: Does mg actually want external adoption?** Maya's flag in the deliberation: the committee's entire recommendation assumes mg wants adoption. If The Scholarly Archive is the actual desired outcome, the robust actions are unnecessary overhead. This is the most important editorial question from the session.
2. **Spec calibration priority**: Three deviations identified. Should they be fixed now (small task) or accumulated and batch-updated after more runs provide more calibration data?
3. **Probe cost**: `/probe` runs N iterations of the full pipeline. At N=3, that's 3× scenarios + 3× committee. Worth discussing with mg whether abbreviated runs are acceptable before committing to a full probe.
4. **Roster customization workflow** (carried from 2026-02-20): Still undocumented. Becoming more relevant as the roster has now been tested in production.
5. **Composed `/decide` skill** (carried from previous session): Manual composition works. Is it time to compose into a single skill, or does more manual testing come first?

## Technical Notes

- **No code execution this session**: All outputs were Markdown files. No Python, no converter testing, no build steps. The session was pure content generation and verification.
- **Windows PowerShell quirks**: `2>/dev/null` doesn't work in PowerShell (it's bash syntax). Use `2>$null` or `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` instead. The session worked around this by not relying on stderr suppression.
- **Directory creation**: `mkdir -p` works in PowerShell via `New-Item -Force`. Used to create `agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/` and `agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/`.

## Watch-Outs for Successor

- **Three deliberation directories, two purposes**: `testing-deliberated-choice-workflow/` is the *meta*-deliberation (committee deciding how to test); `methodology-adoption-strategy/` is the *actual* test run (scenarios + scenario-aware committee on a real problem). Don't confuse them. The assessment (04-evaluation-1.md) lives in the testing directory and evaluates the output in the methodology-adoption directory.
- **The assessment file is in the test-planning directory**: `agent/deliberations/testing-deliberated-choice-workflow/04-evaluation-1.md` contains the three-tier verification of the *methodology-adoption-strategy* run. This is because the assessment is an artifact of the *test*, not of the *deliberation being tested*.
- **Scenario directory is new**: `agent/scenarios/` was created this session. It's the first content in that directory tree. CLAUDE.md already documents it (updated in previous session).
- **No `/review` was run**: The scenario-aware committee deliberation wasn't independently reviewed via `/review`. This could be a useful next step — it would test whether the review skill handles scenario-aware transcripts correctly (the resolution format is different).

## Theoretical/Conceptual Notes

- **The fan→funnel composition works as designed**: The theory (duality-and-composition.md) predicted that scenarios would feed into the committee via a charter bridge and produce a qualitatively different resolution. The live test confirmed this. The scenario-aware resolution has structural fields (robust_actions, scenario_dependent_actions, monitoring_plan, dismissed_futures) that the standard resolution lacks, and the committee's debate demonstrably ranged across futures rather than collapsing to a single framing.
- **The 4-core roster produces adequate divergence**: The Scholarly Archive vs. Accidental Standard vs. Condorcet Bridge vs. Attention Drought are genuinely distinct scenarios that map to all four quadrants of the 2×2 grid. The roster calibration examples in `agent/scenario-roster.md` were predictive — Good Continuity traces compound effects of "more of the same," Good Disruption traces a cascade from a specific point of failure, etc.
- **Meta-stability of using the methodology on itself**: The test used the methodology to deliberate about the project's own strategic direction. Maya flagged this as potentially self-referential. The committee navigated this by choosing a problem that *uses* the methodology to make a decision *about* the project rather than *about* the methodology. This distinction matters — "what strategy should the project pursue?" is a genuine strategic question; "is the methodology good?" is self-referential.
- **Confidence propagation observed in practice**: The scenarios were Medium-confidence (plausible but speculative), and the committee's resolution is correspondingly positioned — it recommends a resilience strategy across scenarios rather than committing to one future, which is exactly what the propagation rule predicts (scenario confidence bounds resolution confidence).

## What Worked Well / What To Do Differently

- **Committee-as-test-designer**: Using the committee to design the test plan was productive. The three-tier framework (structural/process/quality) with PASS/DEVIATION/FAIL classification was more rigorous than an ad-hoc "run it and see." Specific contributions: Maya's "scenario name-dropping" failure mode detection, Vic's stage-gated checklist, Tammy's observation about test problem ↔ test result feedback loops.
- **Real problem as test subject**: The methodology-adoption question was a good choice — genuine uncertainty, concrete reference points (uptake-and-usage.md data), natural divergence axes. The scenarios were specific enough (named actors, numbers, dates) that the committee could reason about them rather than hand-waving.
- **Constraint compliance**: "Do not modify any existing materials" was respected cleanly. All output is in new directories and files. This made the session's footprint easy to verify.
- **Could improve**: The session didn't run `/review` on the scenario-aware deliberation. This would have tested whether the review skill handles the new resolution format and would have closed the quality loop. A natural follow-up.

## Context for Specific Files

| File | Note |
|------|------|
| `agent/deliberations/testing-deliberated-choice-workflow/` | The meta-deliberation. 00-charter through 03-resolution are the committee's test plan. 04-evaluation-1.md is the post-run assessment of the actual test. |
| `agent/scenarios/methodology-adoption-strategy/` | First-ever scenarios directory. 4 scenarios, coverage ADEQUATE. Could serve as reference for future `/scenarios` runs. |
| `agent/deliberations/methodology-adoption-strategy/` | First scenario-aware deliberation. The charter has `scenario_context` and `scenarios_summary` — these are the charter bridge in action. The resolution has `robust_actions`, `scenario_dependent_actions`, `monitoring_plan`, `dismissed_futures` — structural fields absent from standard resolutions. |
| `agent/archive/handoff-2026-02-21-c.md` | Previous handoff (implementation session). Archived with `-c` suffix; `-b` was the theory session earlier today. |
