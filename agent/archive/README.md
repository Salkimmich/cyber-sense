# Archive: Implemented plans

This directory holds **completed plan documents** that have been fully implemented. They are kept for reference and for links from skills and artifacts.

- **augmentation-plan.md** — Committee and review skills with directory-structured deliberation records (00–04, evaluation feedback loop, remediation). All items in §9 are done. Skills and deliberations README reference this file.
- **evaluation-feedback-loop-plan.md** — Stub pointing to augmentation-plan.md §8–9. The evaluation feedback loop design was merged into the augmentation plan; this file is retained so old links resolve.

Current implementation lives in `.claude/skills/committee/`, `.claude/skills/review/`, and `agent/deliberations/README.md`.
