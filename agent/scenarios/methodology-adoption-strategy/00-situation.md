  topic: "Cyberneutics methodology adoption strategy over the next 12 months"
  uncertainties:
    - "Whether depth (more essays, theory) or breadth (new domain applications) drives adoption"
    - "Whether the early-adopter contributors (Condorcet researcher, MOOLLM integration, Residuality Theory contributor) represent a leading indicator or an anomaly"
    - "Whether the methodology's theoretical density is a barrier or an attractor for practitioners"
    - "Whether active outreach or organic discovery produces more durable adoption"
  stakes: "The project's trajectory — whether it remains a personal knowledge base, becomes a practitioner tool, or grows into a community methodology"
  time_horizon: "12 months (February 2026 – February 2027)"

    - "mg (project author and primary contributor)"
    - "Early adopters (Condorcet researcher, MOOLLM/SimHacker, Residuality Theory contributor)"
    - "Potential practitioners (people who might use the methodology if they find it)"
    - "Adjacent communities (AI safety, organizational decision-making, scenario planning)"
  raw_input: "The cyberneutics methodology currently has no external adoption beyond three early signals (two forks, one platform integration). What happens to the project over the next 12 months under different strategic choices?"

# Situation: Cyberneutics Methodology Adoption Strategy

The cyberneutics repository contains a methodology for working with LLMs as collaborative sense-making partners. It includes theoretical essays (10+), practical artifacts (adversarial committees, scenario generation, evaluation rubrics), a formal algebra (palgebra), and a set of agent skills that implement the techniques. The methodology treats LLMs as narrative engines and provides rigorous, traceable techniques for decisions under genuine uncertainty.

As of February 2026, the project has three early adoption signals: a fork exploring different committee makeups with Condorcet jury theorem formalization, a MOOLLM platform integration of the adversarial committee technique, and a fork connecting Deleuzian walks to Residuality Theory. These signals are theoretically engaged — contributors are extending the scaffolding, not just consuming the technique. However, no external deliberation data, rubric scores, or practitioner feedback has been received. The methodology has been validated internally but not externally.

The strategic question is: what should the next 12 months of effort focus on? The space of options includes deepening the theory (more essays, formal treatments), broadening applications (new domains, worked examples), improving accessibility (onboarding guides, simplified entry points), or actively reaching out to adjacent communities. Each path has different implications for what the project becomes and who it serves.
