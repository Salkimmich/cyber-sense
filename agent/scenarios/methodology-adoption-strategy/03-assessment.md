# Coverage Assessment: Methodology Adoption Strategy Scenarios

## Quadrant Coverage

The four scenarios map cleanly to the 2×2 divergence space:

| | Organic growth | Stagnation |
|---|---|---|
| **Depth** | Scenario 3 (Condorcet Bridge) | Scenario 1 (Scholarly Archive) |
| **Breadth** | Scenario 2 (Accidental Standard) | Scenario 4 (Attention Drought) |

Each quadrant has exactly one scenario, providing complete coverage of the divergence axes.

## Distinctness Assessment

The four scenarios are genuinely distinct:

- **Scholarly Archive** vs. **Accidental Standard**: Opposite adoption trajectories (isolation vs. explosive growth) with opposite problems (no audience vs. wrong audience).
- **Condorcet Bridge** vs. **Attention Drought**: Opposite resource availability (leveraged contribution vs. constrained capacity) with opposite external dynamics (intellectual engagement vs. commercial displacement).
- **Scholarly Archive** vs. **Condorcet Bridge**: Same depth orientation but different catalysts — one is author-driven, the other contributor-driven.
- **Accidental Standard** vs. **Attention Drought**: Both involve external forces the author doesn't control, but opposite directions — abundance of attention vs. absence of attention.

No two scenarios tell the same story with different labels.

## Assumption Coherence

Each scenario states 3 explicit assumptions. The assumptions are independent across scenarios — no scenario presupposes another. The assumption sets are internally consistent (no scenario contradicts its own assumptions).

## Potential Gaps

- **Active outreach**: No scenario explores mg deliberately pursuing community-building (conference talks, blog posts, partnerships). All four scenarios treat external engagement as something that happens *to* the project, not something the project *does*. This is a potential blind spot — an intentional marketing/outreach strategy is absent from the scenario set.
- **Hybrid strategies**: No scenario explores doing two things at once (e.g., depth + accessibility). Each scenario assumes a dominant strategy. In practice, mg might pursue a portfolio approach. However, the scenarios' value is in revealing what pure strategies lead to — the committee can synthesize hybrid approaches.

## Sufficiency Judgment

**ADEQUATE.** The 2×2 coverage is complete, the scenarios are distinct, and the gaps (active outreach, hybrid strategies) are more appropriately addressed by the committee deliberation than by additional scenarios. The committee's job is to reason across these futures and identify robust actions — and a "pursue outreach" recommendation can emerge from the deliberation without requiring a fifth scenario.
