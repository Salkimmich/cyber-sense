# Divergence Axis Rationale

**Investment focus** captures the primary resource allocation question: should mg invest in deepening the theoretical foundations (more essays, formal treatments, palgebra extensions) or broadening the practical surface area (new domain applications, worked examples, onboarding material)? This is the axis the author controls.

**Adoption trajectory** captures the key uncertainty the author doesn't control: whether external practitioners discover and adopt the methodology organically, or whether the project remains a sophisticated personal tool with occasional admirers. The three early signals (forks, MOOLLM integration) could be leading indicators of organic growth or they could be one-time curiosity events.

These two axes produce four quadrants:
- **Deep + Growing**: The theory attracts theoretical practitioners who value rigor (the Condorcet researcher pattern)
- **Deep + Stagnant**: Impressive theory that nobody uses because the barrier to entry is too high
- **Broad + Growing**: Practical accessibility drives a community of users who adopt specific techniques
- **Broad + Stagnant**: Lots of examples nobody reads because there's no theoretical hook to make them distinctive

Each core roster member naturally inhabits one of these quadrants, ensuring full coverage.
