# Software Factories

Can we build a dark factory coding agent workflow using palgebra?

NLSpecs as used by StrongDM are restricted GraphViz DOT files.
This is expressive enough to build agent pipelines.

Question: Does DOT incur limitations arising from lack of type checking and structural rigor?

Let's investigate whether palgebra formalism can help.
As a graph expression language, DOT may be isomorphic to some more tractable algebraic expression language.
We already have a functor implementation that turns palgebra into Mermaid.
Maybe we can find a functor that turns palgebra into DOT.

An aside, I think our Mermaid functor could be simplified by using simple names for the text types,
rather than insisting on displaying the (rubric, template) pair.
Just give a name to that pair.
