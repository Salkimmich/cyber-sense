# Narrative Immune Systems

This directory develops an extended analogy between biological immune systems and the mechanisms by which narrative ecosystems — pipelines, pools, institutions, publics — maintain quality and resist pathological content.

The analogy is generative rather than decorative: it predicts missing components, identifies failure modes, and suggests design principles that would not emerge from first principles alone.

### [Narrative Immune Systems](narrative-immune-systems.md)
The theoretical core. Develops the immune analogy in the context of narrative computing and palgebra:

- Generator-discriminator architectures as immune systems (rubrics as antibodies, evaluators as T cells, evaluation protocols as the thymic gauntlet)
- Thymic selection mapped to palgebra type-checking: positive selection as template conformance, negative selection as detection of degenerate parroting
- Two regimes — **pipeline (organ)** and **bath (bloodstream)** — as distinct trust environments with different reasoning frameworks (classical type theory vs. open-world description logic)
- The organ/bloodstream distinction as an explanation for why local agentic AI works better than open-web agentic AI
- Predicted missing components: memory cells (adaptive rubrics), autoimmune disorders (over-aggressive evaluation), immunodeficiency (absent evaluation)
- The civic application: mis/dis/malinformation as a pathogen taxonomy; media literacy as manual T-cell activation vs. LLMs as a thymus — encoded rubrics that automate the screening

### [Social Decision Disruption](social-decision-disruption.md)
Applies the immune analogy to the social and political domain:

- Information warfare as a cholinesterase attack: not direct signal injection, but blockage of signal clearance, causing the social organism to seize on its own overstimulation
- Journalism as homeostatic signaling; false journalism as signal mimicry that occupies receptors without carrying accurate information
- The trust commons: how false journalism destroys the conditions for real journalism rather than merely competing with it
- The autoimmune dimension: when false actors successfully brand real signals as threats, the social body attacks its own nervous system
- LLMs at the inflection point: industrial-scale tools available for both medicine and poison
- Editorial practice as immune function; the open question of whether literacy-rebuilding can outpace the industrialization of the attack

## The Relationship Between the Pieces

[Narrative Immune Systems](narrative-immune-systems.md) works at the level of **formal architecture** — pipeline design, type systems, agent infrastructure, the palgebra formalism.

[Social Decision Disruption](social-decision-disruption.md) works at the level of **civic epistemology** — journalism, information warfare, public trust, democratic coordination.

Both are instances of the same underlying claim: that quality in a narrative ecosystem requires immune function — discrimination, pattern recognition, bounded feedback, memory — and that the failure modes map predictably to immune failure modes (pathogen mimicry, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorder).

The two perspectives are complementary. The formal architecture piece explains *how* to build immune function into a pipeline. The civic piece explains *why* that matters at scale — and what the stakes are when the immune system of a society's information environment breaks down.

## Open Threads

See the open threads section of [Narrative Immune Systems](narrative-immune-systems.md) for formal extensions: bath-model palgebra, adaptive rubrics, information warfare as immune evasion, the pipeline/bath interface, and regulatory mechanisms for the evaluation system itself.
